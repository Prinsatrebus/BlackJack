# BlackJack
Milestone Project #3

The Variables.py file contains the required variables, classes, and methods for all the objects and attributes.

The Blackjack.py file contains the execution file and the game logic to complete an entire game against the dealer.

note: There is currently no end condition for when the player or the dealer runs out of money; I still need to add that in.
